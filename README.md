# SkyBet iOS/Android Tech Test

## Scenario

You are asked to build a new feature for a betting App, this is to allow the user to login using a 4 digit PIN or use TouchID/Face ID depending on device once authenticated the user will then see a list of runners in a horse race.

On initial load the App should ask for the user to enter a PIN which needs to be stored securely on the device.

On subsequent launches the App should ask for either a PIN / finger print / face Id depending on the users device preference.

The App should load a WebView and load the skybet website https://m.skybet.com


## What we require
As well as solving the above senario.

You should also build and demonstrate a robust mechanism to allow the App to send messages to the Web Client.

The product owner has given you some free reign to implement features that you think the user might be interested in having. This could include Animations, notifications etc. Note you may be asked to explain why you have implemented some features.

You should support the latest OS for devices and the last preceding one. e.g iOS 11 & iOS 10.

## Expectations

We value well structured, modular, reusable code with unit tests that is easily maintainable.

Spend up to 6 hours over no more than 5 days on this. We expect to see regular commits to Git with meaningful commit messages.

You will write this in Objective-C for iOS & Java/Kotlin for Android

You should not use a code generation tool/frameworks

For Android apps we expect you to use the latest version of Android Studio, and for iOS the latest version of XCode. No Beta versions.

## What to submit

* A bundled/archived repository showing your commit history, for example:

```git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all --branches```

* A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
